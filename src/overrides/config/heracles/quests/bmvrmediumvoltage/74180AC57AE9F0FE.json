You may already know a few of them, like Petrol, Plastic, Alcohol... well, in GregTech, you'll mass-produce many of these things, and more! This topic can be confusing at times, so you'll want to read carefully in order to avoid getting lost in the details. Now...",

There are two main paths you can take: &&6Petrochemicals&&r and &&aBiochemicals&&r. Both have their pros and cons - Petrochemicals typically provide &&9higher yields&&r and &&benergy-efficiency&&r, while Biochemicals are fully &&drenewable&&r. Your source of Power and Plastics is entirely &&bup to you&&r.",
