      "You have likely realised by now that the Energy system in &&2GregTech&&r is &&cnowhere near as simple&&r as the &&1RF&&r you may be used to using in modded Minecraft.",

      "The energy unit of GregTech is the EU.",
      "<br/>",
      "&&1EU&&r mechanics have a certain flair to them, and are not dissimilar to real-world electricity. They can also be &&4dangerous and punishing&&r if mishandled. However, the power system gives GregTech players a lot of &&6satisfaction&&r when harnessed well.",

      "&&l&&3Lore:&&r&&o The Amperage bug, exploit or feature (call it whatever you want!) from 1.12.2 GTCE has been &&lfixed&&r&&o in GTCEu. The Energy network now works as intended.",

These &&apackets&&r have two parameters: a &&2Voltage&&r tier determined by the tier of the Producer, and &&dAmperage&&r. This determines how much &&9Power&&r can actually be transferred. ",
      "<br/>",
      "There are no partial Amps, meaning Energy is transferred only if the full Amp &&apacket&&r can be received. You might notice this from your machines sitting just below full EU capacity - they will only accept EU when they are missing at least 1A of their input voltage.",

      "In summary, Energy is transported in &&apackets&&r of &&132EU&&r for &&7LV&&r, &&1128EU&&r for &&bMV&&r... so on and so forth. The amount of energy that is actually received by a machine can end up being lower than energy sent, due to cable loss.",
      "<br/>",
      "Machine Energy Input is limited by &&2Voltage&&r (too high and, well, &&6boom&&r!), and by &&dAmperage&&r. Thus, a &&bMV&&r Machine with &&d2A&&r Input connected to a &&7LV&&r line will never accept more than &&964EU/t&&r.",
