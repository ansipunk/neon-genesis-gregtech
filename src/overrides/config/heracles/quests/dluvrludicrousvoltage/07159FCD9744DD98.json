      "The &&3Active Transformer&&r has a second use - &&6Laser Power&&r. Lasers are like superconductors, but behave slightly differently. They share the energy input across all connected active transformers, allowing widespread power distribution. You can use &&3Active Transformers&&r to convert regular EU to and from Lasers.",
