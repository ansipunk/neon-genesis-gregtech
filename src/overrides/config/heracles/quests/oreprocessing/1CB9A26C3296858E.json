      "One could define a Subnetwork &&7(or \"Subnet\" for short)&&r as any network that isn't part of your main network.",

      "The simplest way to create a Subnet is by attaching an &&bME Interface&&r to a &&aStorage Bus&&r. This means that the Storage Bus will treat the Interface as an inventory to be read from - i.e., it'll be able to see &&5all of the items&&r in the network connected to the Interface.",
      "<br/>",
      "As your main network will &&4not&&r be transferred through the Storage Bus, you'll need to give your subnet power from the main network with &&6Quartz Fibre&&r. Ensure that you don't accidentally connect the two networks with regular cabling.",

      "Question is - how does this &&abenefit you&&r as a player? The logistics powers made available with subnetworking are immense, so we'll cover a few examples &&9in light detail&&r. The rest is left as an exercise to the reader!",

      "- A subnet for your ore processing system, which &&bautomatically handles&&r all the intermediate byproducts without them constantly entering and exiting your main network!",

      "Subnets can be infinitely nested, but as always in &&bmodded Minecraft&&r, this should be performed in moderation (or even better, avoided), as many levels of nesting can cause &&4performance issues&&r when calculating the network.",

      "Oh... and if you've re-enabled Channels in this pack, subnetworks only consume a single channel from your main network. What a bargain!"
